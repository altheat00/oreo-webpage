        <h3>My Neighbor Totoro (1988)</h3>
        <p>Sisters Satsuki and Mei move to the countryside to be nearer to their invalid mother, who is recuperating in hospital, and while exploring the house and its woodland surroundings, they discover a trio of “Totoro,” or forest spirits, who come in three sizes: small (white), medium (blue) and extra-large (the ginormous gray beast with a big smile and boomerang-shaped chest markings).</p>

        <h4> Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</h4>
        <p>Grave of the Fireflies” (adapted from Akiyuki Nosaka’s 1967 novel) represents the artform’s unique potential to tackle subjects too grim for most audiences to handle via live-action — a lesson later applied to films such as “Waltz With Bashir” and “Funan.” Here, Takahata presents audiences with the Japanese side of a devastating war, observing the wrenching toll this conflict takes on two children, 14-year-old Seita and his 4-year-old sister Setsuke, who are orphaned during the U.S. fire-bombing of Kobe.</p>

        <h5>Spirited Away (2001)</h5>
        <p>Given the sheer ambition and scope of the film — a Japanese spin on such Western classics as “Alice and Wonderland” and “Peter Pan,” in which 10-year-old Chiro crosses the river to an enchanted bathhouse from which, if she’s not careful, she may never be able to return — it’s no wonder that those who started with “Spirited Away” have trouble working backwards through the Ghibli catalog.</p>

        <h6>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013)</h6>
        <p>It’s a story Asian audiences know well — about a princess from the moon who wishes to experience life on earth, where she challenges her suitors to a series of impossible tasks — and this gives Takahata room to express his own interpretation, as he lovingly does in early scenes.</p>

        <h7>Kiki's Delivery Service (1989)</h7>
        <p>“Kiki’s Delivery Service” presents its young heroine with a very gentle challenge: Far from home and somewhat uncertain of her abilities, Kiki discovers that her powers seem to be fading, just one of the movie’s clever metaphors for growing up.</p>

        <h7>Perfect Blue</h7>
        <p>Perfect Blue is as close to a perfect psychological thriller as feasibly possible and remains one of the most influential animated movies of all time, serving as inspiration for directors like Darren Aronofsky. </p>
